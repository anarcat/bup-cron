Packaging
---------

`bup-cron` is hooked into distutils and is published on PyPI. To
operate those releases, you will need [pip][] and [twine][] to make
uploads:

    sudo apt-get install pip twine

... or follow the instructions in the [pip install documentation][]
then:

    pip install twine

You will also need a registered account on [pip][] with access to the
`bup-cron` project.

Testing instructions
--------------------

To run the tests, you'll need a copy of the [bup source][] because we
are using the bup test suite, for historical reasons (we wanted to be
in core originally).

Simply get a copy of the bup source and uncompress it in the parent
directory (`../bup`). The test suite also assumes the `bup` is in the
path and is at least at version `0.26`.

The tests are in the [t/](t) directory.
